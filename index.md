### Why another relativity textbook?

As an eager sophomore in university, I tried to teach myself general relativity from the usual textbooks. I found them long-winded, hard to understand, and filled with excessive formalism surrounding manifolds and tensors. Eventually, I came across Paul Dirac's _General Theory of Relativity_, a 70-page masterpiece that develops the theory simply and logically. From there, I filled out my knowledge using more standard textbooks. I came to realize that the theory only seems difficult due to a few subtle concepts that are not carefully explained in any one place. So, I decided to do it myself. It took several months longer than I expected, but here is the result. I hope it helps you wherever you are in your physics journey.
