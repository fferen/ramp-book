### Why another relativity textbook?

As an eager undergrad in electrical engineering, I tried to teach myself general relativity from the usual textbooks. I found them to be hard to understand and filled with unintuitive formalism. Eventually, I came across Paul Dirac's _General Theory of Relativity_, a 70-page masterpiece that presents the theory logically and . From there, I filled out my knowledge using more standard textbooks. I came to realize that the theory is not so hard to understand, but features subtle concepts that are not carefully explained in any one place. So, I decided to do it myself.
