title: Relativity: A Modern Primer
---

A short and sweet textbook on Einstein's theory of relativity, and more.

## Why another relativity textbook?

Learning relativity was a long journey for me. From college courses to self-study, I needed many resources to fully understand the theory, and eventually felt that I could explain it better and with fewer words than other textbooks. This project took longer than expected, but here is the result.

### Features

1. **Concise**: Only about 100 pages long.
2. **Deep**: Unlike a popular physics book, we will dive into the math. Keep a pencil and paper handy.
3. **Broad**: In addition to special and general relativity, it covers Lagrangian mechanics, a bit of electromagnetism, and an introduction to cosmology.
4. **Pedagogical**: Clear explanations with many figures and exercises. Exercises are marked by difficulty with 1-3 stars (\*). I have tried to find the most intuitive way to understand each concept, and I anticipate common points of confusion based on my own experience.

### Prerequisites

Vector calculus and classical mechanics. Basically, a standard freshman or sophomore physics curriculum in the US. Some knowledge of linear algebra and electromagnetism will also help, although Appendix A develops the necessary linear algebra.
