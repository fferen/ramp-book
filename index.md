title: Relativity: A Modern Primer
---

A short and sweet textbook on Einstein's theory of relativity.

### Why another relativity textbook?

As an eager sophomore in university, I tried to teach myself general relativity from the usual textbooks. I found them long-winded, hard to understand, and filled with excessive formalism surrounding manifolds and tensors. Eventually, I came across Paul Dirac's _General Theory of Relativity_, a 70-page masterpiece that develops the theory simply and logically. This gave me the foundation to fill out my knowledge using more standard textbooks. I came to realize that relativity only seems difficult due to a few subtle concepts that are not concisely explained in any one place. So, I decided to do it myself. It took several months longer than expected, but here is the result.

Some features include:

1. **Concise**: Only about 100 pages long.
2. **Deep**: Unlike a popular physics book, we will dive into the math. Keep a pencil and paper handy.
3. **Broad**: In addition to special and general relativity, it covers Lagrangian mechanics, a bit of electromagnetism, and an introduction to cosmology.
4. **Pedagogical**: Clear explanations with many figures and exercises. Exercises are marked by difficulty with 1-3 stars (\*). I have tried to find the most intuitive way to understand each concept, and I anticipate common points of confusion based on my own experience.

I hope it helps you wherever you are in your physics journey.
